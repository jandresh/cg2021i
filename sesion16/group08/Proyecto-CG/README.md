# Final Project-CG Game level 3
# Diego Fernando Mu√±oz Arce 2010032
It has been chosen to develop and add a third level to the sample of the game that brings two previously developed levels. Following the rubric that is evident in the first level, the new one is developed with the same purpose of activating all the buttons to open a door that allows advancing to the next level, increasing a little the difficulty. The main character moves with the A and D keys and can jump with the space bar. The first two levels that the sample brings can be skipped with the L key to go directly to the level developed in this project.

# Implementations:
- Creation of the GameLevel_03.js and Level3.xml files together with their respective graphic resources folder for the textures and a game over screen.
- Change of level background textures.
- Change in camera: added a vertical tracking of the main character.
- Implementation of a new gameObject (smaller platform).
- Change in the physics of the game such as the jump height of the character.
- Extension of the length of the level.
- Implementation of audio for the level and special effects in the game.
- Life limitation: the player has a maximun of 3 attepmts to win the game.
