## 2D multiplayer game üöÄ

**Hero** is a **2D game** that allows you to play between two people. One player is in charge of firing the bombs using the computer mouse, while the other player tries to dodge them using the WASD keys.

This is a **multilevel game** that advances each time the Hero loses the total number of lives per level. Bombs are fired from different random points on the screen and each one has a different time duration. The platforms are shields that help the Hero to protect himself. They come out at different positions in each level. The minions are soldiers that move through the window and help protect the Hero from the bullets.
