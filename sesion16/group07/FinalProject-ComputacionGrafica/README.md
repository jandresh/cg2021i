<h1>"Fireboy and Watergirl"</h1>

<p>This game is based on the popular game "Fireboy and Watergirl". These two characters can move through a single stage map. On the map, they must overcome obstacles and traps until they reach the goal.</p>

<h2>Game description</h2>

<p>On the one hand, the Fireboy character (red boy) represents fire and cannot touch the water element. On the other hand Watergirl (girl in blue) represents water and cannot touch the fire element. However, there is an exception and both characters can touch each other.</p>

<p>Both characters can move at the same time on the map. But they cannot go through walls and they cannot touch the opposing element or the toxic substance because they will lose their lives and the game will end.</p>

<p>The two characters can run, jump, take diamonds of the same element, and press switches to move platforms.</p>

<h2>Objective of the game</h2>

<p>The objective of this game is to overcome all the obstacles on the map until you reach two doors, one door will be for Fireboy and another for Watergirl. To win the game, both characters must enter the corresponding doors.</p>
