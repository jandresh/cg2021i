# LABERINTO

DESCRIPTION

This game written in JavaScript for WebGL using THREE.js

three.js is a lightweight library written in JavaScript to create and display 3D computer animated
graphics in a web browser and can be used in conjunction with the HTML5 canvas element, SVG or WebGL.

This game consists of 5 levels, which you will have to overcome to win, all within the allowed time.
You can control the camera with up, down, right and left arrows keys or use the virtual keys on bottom right.
The goal is to cross the maze in the 5 levels in less than 120 seconds. To overcome each level we must find 
the place where itâ€™s located in the blue point shown in the minimap on top left.

At the beginning of the game, we can see the rendering of the textures representing a maze.

When colliding with the walls, a sound is activated, evidencing the collision between the objects.
A background sound was added to give the game a little more interactivity.
